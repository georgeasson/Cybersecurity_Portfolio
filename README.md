# Cybersecurity_Portfolio
A repository to display my cybersecurity skills. To show potential employers what I've been up to.

Currently I am working on the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate through Coursera. I will update the files in this repository as I go to showcase what I have learned on this course.
